The 2019 Statistical Learning Summer Workshop is an opportunity for Carnegie Mellon graduate students from outside the domains of statistics and machine learning to gain experience in statistical learning, the attempt to discover underlying associations between variables in a dataset. (A simple example of statistical learning would be discovering the association between a person's measured height and his or her measured weight.) The goals of the workshop are to broaden statistical knowledge among CMU's graduate students and in so doing to encourage "vertical integration," wherein graduate students assume important advisory roles in data analyses carried out on behalf of faculty members by, e.g., undergraduate or Master's students.

The SLSW is organized by Peter Freeman, Joel Greenhouse, and Rebecca Nugent of the Department of Statistics & Data Science. It has been made possible thanks to the support of

- The Office of the Vice Provost for Education (Amy Burkert, Suzie Laurich-McIntyre); and 
- The Data Science Initiative within CMU's Department of Statistics & Data Science (Rebecca Nugent).

During the program, SLSW participants will engage in the "deliberate practice" of statistical learning, from exploratory data analysis through the application of commonly used regression and classification methods, with a focus on application, not theory. The workshop will combine lectures and laboratory exercises, and will culminate with the presentation of analyses that groups will engage in over its duration.

Previous knowledge of statistics and statistical computing platforms (specifically, R) is *not assumed*.
